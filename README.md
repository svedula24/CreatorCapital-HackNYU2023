# HackNYU2023 - 2nd Place Financial Empowerment WINNER


## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project comes from our belief that content creators are essential to the entertainment industry, and that they are sources of high potential for investment, who often struggle to secure the capital they need to produce high-quality content. We recognize that investors are looking for new and innovative ways to make returns on their money, and we see an opportunity to connect these two groups through an investment platform that allows content creators to access the capital they need, while providing investors with the opportunity to earn a return on their investment. We are passionate about supporting the creative industry and helping content creators to build sustainable and profitable careers, and we believe that our investment platform can be a powerful tool for achieving these goals.

## What it does
Our project is an investment platform that allows individuals to invest in their favorite content creators by owning a portion of their brand/platform. Our platform creates a unique opportunity for investors to support the creative industry while also making a profitable investment. By providing content creators with a sustainable source of funding, our platform helps support the future of content creation and allows creators to focus on producing the best content possible. Additionally, our platform provides a new way for investors to diversify their portfolios and invest in a new industry. 

## How we built it
1.) Our investment platform was built using a combination of programming languages and tools. First, we designed the platform's user interface using web development tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which provide a sleek, responsive, and intuitive interface. For the main functionality of our platform, we used the Python programming language, in combination with the pandas and seaborn libraries; these helped us create the data visualizations that are presented on our webpage.

2.) For our backend we used Flask to handle routing and send data needed for data visualizations, youtube API, channel information, etc. 

3. We update the user on their investments and user activity through Twilio API

## Challenges we ran into
1.) Trouble performing certain data visualization tasks
2.) Integrating our front end with our back end--running our project on a server

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we were able to execute our content creator investment idea and create a unique opportunity for investors to diversify their portfolios and invest in the content creation industry, which has traditionally been difficult for investors to access.

## What we learned
1.) Flask
2.) NumPy
3.) Pandas
4.) Seaborn

## What's next for Creator Capital
Moving forward, we have several plans for our investment platform for content creators. We plan on developing more advanced tools for content creators, such as analytics dashboards and content management systems, to help them better manage and grow their platforms. We also want to partner with other platforms and services in the content creation industry to provide a more seamless and integrated experience for our users. We plan to expand our reach by expanding to new content creators and investors and building a stronger presence in the content creation industry.
